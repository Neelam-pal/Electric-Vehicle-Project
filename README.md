# 🚗⚡ US Electric Car Registrations & Renewable Energy Production

## 📌 Project Overview  
This capstone project explores the relationship between **electric vehicle (EV) registrations** and **renewable energy production** across the United States. By analyzing state-level data from **1990 to 2019**, the study uncovers patterns, trends, and correlations that reflect how the growth of EV adoption aligns with the development of renewable energy infrastructure (solar, wind, hydro, geothermal).

Through **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **geospatial visualization**, **time series analysis**, and **predictive modeling**, this project identifies regional leaders, laggards, and key insights that can support policy-making, investments, and sustainable energy planning.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Integrate and preprocess datasets on EV registrations, renewable energy production, and state codes.  
- Perform **spatial analysis** of EV registrations across U.S. states.  
- Compare EV adoption trends with **renewable energy projects**.  
- Conduct **time series analysis (1990–2019)** for growth trends.  
- Analyze **correlation** between EV adoption and renewable energy production.  
- Identify **leading and lagging states** in the clean energy transition.  
- Provide **recommendations** for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and researchers.

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Natural Gas, Nuclear, and Hydro** remain the top contributors to U.S. energy supply.  
- **Wind and Solar growth** show a **moderate positive correlation** with EV adoption.  
- **Coal-dependent states** tend to have **lower EV penetration**.  
- **Western & Northeastern states** lead EV adoption due to stronger incentives and infrastructure.  
- **Geospatial analysis** reveals uneven EV adoption—coastal and urban states dominate while central/rural states lag behind.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Neelam-pal/ElectricVehicle-Capstone.git
2. Open the notebook
   ```bash

✅ Conclusion
This analysis shows that renewable energy expansion positively influences EV adoption, but adoption varies by policy, infrastructure, and state priorities.
1. Coastal & urban states drive EV adoption.
2. Fossil-fuel states lag behind.
3. A moderate positive correlation exists between renewables and EV adoption, highlighting the importance of policy alignment between transportation and energy sectors.
